- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Follow [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

- **Commit Messages**: Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for commit messages (for example: `✨ Add feature`, `🐛 Fix bug`). Each commit should be focused on a single purpose.
- **File Naming**: Follow lowercase and kebab-case (`file-name.js` or `function-name.php`).
